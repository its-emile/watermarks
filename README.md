# Watermarks for LLMs
Python experiments to add, and detect watermarks in natural language text.
Relevant (but not used): Kirchenbauer et al, 2023

With my initial algorithm, some of the original inspiration came from markov chain based text steganography (H Moraldo, 2014) before LLMs offered reliable probabilities for next token.

A more robust implementation (including Reed Solomon error correction) is exciting, available [here](https://github.com/jfairoze/publicly-detectable-watermark)
